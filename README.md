## 📘 Project Overview

**Mughal Empire: A Chronicle of Cruelty, Courage & Concealed Truths** is a truth-based, decolonized historical handout that exposes the brutality of the Mughal Empire, the temple destruction campaigns, the persecution of Brahmins, and the systematic cultural genocide erased from modern Indian textbooks like NCERT.

This dharmic document revives forgotten facts:  
- The burning of Nalanda and Takshashila  
- The reality of Akbar’s Meena Bazaar and Jauhar  
- The tyranny of Aurangzeb in Kashi and Mathura  
- The untold valor of Hindu kings, saints, and scholars

This project is **not just history** — it’s **civilizational restoration**.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists

In modern India, students are taught that the Mughal rulers were “great administrators and patrons of art.”  
But they are never told about:
- **Babur's destruction of Ayodhya’s temples**
- **Aurangzeb’s orders to demolish Kashi Vishwanath**
- **The 6-month-long burning of Nalanda by Bakhtiyar Khilji**
- **The spiritual and martial resistance by Brahmins, Bhakti saints, and Rajput warriors**

This handout challenges the mainstream, Marxist-whitewashed narrative.

> 🔥 This is a tool of **memory warfare** — forged not in academia, but in anguish.
